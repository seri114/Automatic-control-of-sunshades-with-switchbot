## GAS script for open/close shade automatically.

## What is it?
Sample GAS project for closing and opening a sunshade operated by Switchbot synchronized with sunset time to prevent the sun from setting in the west.

## How does it work?
Each morning, get the sunset time and set a trigger to operate the sunshade at that time plus an offset.

Sunshade operations are performed by calling the SwitchBot API directly.

## Usage
Copy this spreadsheet to your own Google Drive and run the built-in GAS script.
